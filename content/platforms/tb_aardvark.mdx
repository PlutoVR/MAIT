# Aardvark

Aardvark is a framework for building augmented reality "gadgets" that run on top of virtual reality experiences. Gadgets are constructed using a bunch of custom React components and run in the Aardvark application. Gadgets use these components to show interactive models, 2D UI, or other stuff that will draw on top of any VR applications you run. You can attach these gadgets to your hands and bring them with you in your favorite VR apps.

The [Aardvark Slack](https://aardvarkxr.slack.com/) is extremely welcoming and highly recommended to join if youâ€™re developing Aardvark gadgets or interested in doing so.

_Important distinction: while Aardvark gadgets are written in Javascript, React and Typescript, they compile to OpenVR and are \_not \_based in WebXR._

# The Pluto Gadget

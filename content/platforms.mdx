# Multi App Platforms

There are two main ways to experience and develop XR multi apps; the first is [Aardvark](./tools/tb_aardvark) and the second is [WebXR](./tools/tb_webxr) (using XR Packages and Metachromium).

Both options include multi-user integration powered by Pluto, and the stack you choose depends on your goals, your previous experience with either stack, and general preferences.

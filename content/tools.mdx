# Multi App Development Paths

There are two main ways to experience and develop XR multi apps; [Aardvark](./tools/tb_aardvark) and [Chimera/WebXR](./tools/tb_chimera). Both options include multi-user integration powered by Pluto, and the stack you choose depends on your goals, your previous experience with either stack, and general preferences.

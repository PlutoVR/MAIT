# First-time Setup

To experience the power of multi app XR, you will want to make sure you're using a
machine strong enough to run desktop VR - namely, [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/) and [SteamVR](https://store.steampowered.com/app/250820/SteamVR/), since that is the ecosystem both multi
app solutions (Aardvark and WebXR) rely on.

Once you have both installed, and confirm you're able to run SteamVR with your HMD, continue in the path of your choice:

[Aardvark](./platforms/tb_aardvark)

[WebXR](./platforms/tb_webxr)

[Miscellaneous Useful Tools](./platforms/tb_misc)
